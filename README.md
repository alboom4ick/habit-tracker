# Dev process 
Preparing the UI with warm and harmonic color patterns. I used: 
#F5EEDD
#7AE2CF
#077A7D
#06202B
In general I tried to make the UX smooth and adjustable.

# Information about the unique approaches 
Added click counting feature that helps the developers to know, which buttons are indeed useful for their users. 

# Compromises 
As the time was limited, it was necessary to put my attention on the main things first. So I made the habit tracker, but didn't make the analysis.

# Common errors
Don't rush to make the app a top notch product. Firstly focus on the MVP. In addition, troubles in deploying the backend.

# Why I picked web dev?
Because it is a great extension for my current skills in ML. With the web development I can create a both good looking, well functioning product powered with AI.
